# Metron AI - Catalogue

Metron AI Catalogue contains Metron project specific artifacts. Artifacts (e.g. datasets, weights, binaries) are handeled using [DVC](https://dvc.org/), which means that artifacts are versioned and they are physically stored elsewhere. The repository stores only pointers to the actual artifact. On top of the artifacts, the repository stores configurations of the artifacts.

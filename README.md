# Metron AI - Datasets

Metron AI Datasets contains Metron project specific datasets. Datasets are handeled using [DVC](https://dvc.org/), which means that datasets are versioned and they are physically stored elsewhere. The repository stores only pointers to the actual datasets. On top of the datasets, the repository stores configurations of datasets created by Metron AI Artificial Data Generator.
